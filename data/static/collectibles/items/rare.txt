R61|Rick Kackis|What is up guys? I'm RICK KACKIS and today we are going to be taking a much closer look at the Hung Jury SR4 scout rifle. This is a new weapon added into Destiny 2 with Season of the Splicer. This weapon used to exist in Destiny 1 and was arguably the best weapon in the game. People were so excited to see this weapon return that Hung Jury was TRENDING on Twitter, but how good is this thing in Destiny 2? Well, in this video, we are going to be looking at its stats and perks to determine its PvP and PvE GOD rolls so you guys know what to farm for. And so... Let's get started.|rare
